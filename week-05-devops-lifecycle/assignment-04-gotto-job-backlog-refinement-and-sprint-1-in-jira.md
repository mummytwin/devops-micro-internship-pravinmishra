# Assignment 4 — Gotto Job: Backlog Refinement & Sprint 1 in Jira

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this 90-minute, time-boxed exercise, you will act as a Scrum team — or run in Solo Mode, playing every role yourself — to turn the Gotto Job template into a value-ordered backlog, estimate the work in story points, plan Sprint 1, open the burndown chart, and ship one small UI-only increment (text, color, spacing, a label, or a CTA — no backend changes).

---

# Task 1 — Roles & Mode Setup (Team vs Solo)

## Goal

Choose Team Mode or Solo Mode, and document how each Scrum role (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Lead, DevOps Lead) was handled.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Jira "Create project" screen, or the project sidebar after creation

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 1.png>).

---

### Notes

Write one line for each role: PO (what you prioritized), SM (how you ensured process), Dev Lead (what you built), DevOps Lead (how you shipped).

Write your answer here.

---

# Task 2 — Create the Jira Project (Team-managed → Scrum)

## Goal

Create a Team-managed Scrum project named `Gotto Job – Team <#>` (Team Mode) or `Gotto Job – <YourName>` (Solo Mode).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Project created page showing the project name and key

---

# Task 3 — Create the Epic

## Goal

Create the Epic `Improve Gotto Job UI discoverability & trust` to group the UI improvement initiative.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Backlog showing the Epic panel with the Epic visible

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 3.png>).

---

# Task 4 — Seed the Product Backlog (6–8 Stories + Fibonacci Points + Ranking)

## Goal

Create at least six Stories under the Epic, estimate each with 1, 2, or 3 story points, and rank them by value.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Backlog showing the Epic and at least six Stories under it

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 4.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 5 — One Story opened showing its Story Points and acceptance criteria filled in

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 5.png>).

---

# Task 5 — Planning Poker (Estimate + Debate Notes)

## Goal

Confirm the Story Points (1, 2, or 3) for each Story and record brief reasoning for each estimate.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Backlog showing Story Points visible, or two or three Stories opened showing their points

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 6.png>).

---

### Notes

For each story, explain in one or two lines why it is a 1, 2, or 3 (mention any debate, even in Solo Mode).

Primary CTA color (1 pt)
One CSS property change applied site-wide. Considered a 2 briefly because it affects multiple pages, but since it's a single selector update in the stylesheet, 1 point was the right call.

Job detail Apply Now CTA (1 pt)
Adding one HTML button with a mailto: or # link. No backend logic, no new page, no routing. Straightforward addition above the fold  clearly a 1.

Hero tagline clarity (1 pt)
Single text change in one HTML element with no layout or styling impact. In Solo Mode, no debate was needed, the effort is clearly minimal and the value is immediate.

Footer trust links (1 pt)
Two anchor tags added to an existing footer element. Minimal markup change with no CSS complexity. Debated whether internal routing added risk, but since links point to existing pages, 1 point stands.

Job card typography (2 pts)
Requires identifying all card title CSS selectors across the Job Listing and Job Detail pages and verifying visual dominance on both. More surface area and cross-page testing than a single-element change  justified 2 points.

Posted on date text (1 pt)
Static text addition per card. Simple but requires consistent application across multiple job cards. Considered a 2 due to repetition across cards, but since the change is copy-paste with no logic, 1 point was agreed upon.

---

# Task 6 — Sprint Planning: Create Sprint 1 + Sprint Goal + Scope

## Goal

Create Sprint 1, move three or four Stories into it (approximately 3–6 points), set the Sprint Goal, and break each selected Story into Build, Verify, Deploy, and Screenshot Sub-tasks.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Sprint 1 with the selected Stories inside it

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 7.png>).

---

#### Screenshot 8 — One Story showing the Sub-tasks created

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 8.png>).

---

# Task 7 — Reports: Open Burndown Chart

## Goal

Open the Burndown Chart and confirm it exists for Sprint 1. It is acceptable if the chart is not yet populated.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Burndown Chart page opened, even if empty

![](<screenshots/Assignment 4/Screenshot 9(a).png>).

---

# Task 8 — Ship One Small Increment (Build + Deploy + Proof)

## Goal

Implement one small UI-only Story from Sprint 1, commit it, deploy it live, and move the Story and its Sub-tasks to Done in Jira.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Jira board showing the Story moved to Done

# Task 9 — Retro Notes (Scrum Pillar + Value)

### Evidence
